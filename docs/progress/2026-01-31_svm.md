## 1. Objective of Today’s Work

The objective of today’s work is to implement and evaluate a **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** model for the fall detection task using the SisFall dataset.  
This experiment aims to:

- Build an SVM-based classification pipeline
- Extract statistical features from IMU signals
- Evaluate the performance of SVM with a linear kernel
- Analyze the impact of decision threshold on model performance
- Provide a scientific comparison baseline for other models (Random Forest, XGBoost)

## 2. Feature Extraction from IMU Signals

### 2.1 Input Data

The raw IMU signals are segmented into fixed-length **sliding windows**.  
Each window contains **6 signal channels**, corresponding to accelerometer and gyroscope axes.

### 2.2 Extracted Features

For each window, statistical features are extracted from every channel:

- Mean value
- Standard deviation
- Maximum value
- Minimum value
- Signal energy (mean squared value)

As a result:
- **5 features per channel**
- **6 channels**
- **Total: 30 features per window**

After feature extraction:
- Total number of samples: **56,233**
- Feature vector dimension: **30**

## 3. Data Normalization and Train/Test Split

The dataset is split into:
- **80% training set**
- **20% testing set**

Stratified sampling is applied to preserve the class distribution between fall and ADL samples.

Since SVM models are sensitive to feature scaling, **StandardScaler** is applied:
- Mean of features ≈ 0
- Standard deviation ≈ 1

## 4. Training the Linear SVM Model

### 4.1 Model Configuration

- Model: **Support Vector Machine (Linear Kernel)**
- Purpose:
  - Evaluate linear separability of the extracted features
  - Serve as a baseline SVM model for comparison

### 4.2 Evaluation at Default Threshold (Threshold = 0)

Evaluation results on the test set:

- Accuracy: approximately **79.8%**
- F1-score (Fall class): approximately **0.74**
- Recall (Fall class): approximately **0.66**

📌 *Insert figure here*

**Observation:**
- The model achieves reasonable overall accuracy.
- However, the recall for the Fall class remains relatively low, indicating that a significant number of fall events are missed.

## 5. Decision Threshold Analysis

To further analyze the behavior of the SVM model, different decision thresholds are evaluated:

- Threshold = −1.0
- Threshold = −0.5
- Threshold = 0.0
- Threshold = 0.5
- Threshold = 1.0

For each threshold, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix are computed.

📌 *Insert figure here*

**Figure 4.** Performance comparison of the Linear SVM model under different decision threshold values.

### 5.1 Analysis

- **Low thresholds (−1.0, −0.5):**
  - Very high recall for Fall detection
  - Low precision, resulting in many false alarms
  - Overall accuracy significantly decreases

- **High thresholds (0.5, 1.0):**
  - High precision
  - Recall drops sharply, leading to many missed fall events

- No threshold provides a good balance between high fall recall and acceptable overall accuracy.

---

## 6. Overall Evaluation of the SVM Model

The Linear SVM model demonstrates the following characteristics:

- Suitable as a **baseline model**
- Limited ability to model nonlinear decision boundaries
- High trade-off between recall and precision when tuning the decision threshold

As fall detection is a safety-critical application, missing fall events is unacceptable.  
Therefore, **the Linear SVM model is not selected as the final model for the fall detection system**, but it provides valuable insights for comparative analysis.

---

## 7. Model Saving

Two configurations of the trained SVM model are saved locally:

- **Baseline configuration:** default threshold (0.0)
- **High-recall configuration:** threshold optimized for higher fall recall

The saved files include:
- Trained SVM model
- Feature scaler
- Feature description
- Windowing parameters

These model files are stored locally and excluded from the GitHub repository to avoid large file uploads.

---

## 8. Next Steps

- Implement and evaluate **XGBoost** using the same feature extraction and preprocessing pipeline
- Compare the performance of:
  - Random Forest
  - SVM
  - XGBoost
- Select the most suitable model for deployment in the final fall detection system
